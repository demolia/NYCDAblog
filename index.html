                <h2>Week 4 </h2>
                <p class="main-text">
                    This week we started learning back-end (or server-side, those two are interchangeable) development. To make a clear comparison (which at least worked for me) is to see a stage of a theatre in front of you. You are the audience. You can only see what is happening on the stage itself. The front-end, this is HTML5, CSS(3) and JavaScript. But there is also happening a lot behind the stage, this you can not see and that is why its called back-end. <br>
                    <br>
                    We started learning to create a database and display this information to the user. (database backend - user is front-end). What we did was learning how to create a database and learning how to work with it. We had lecture on Monday and a bit on Tuesday. For the rest of the week we had one big assignment. This assignment was to work with Ajax (A->jax not like Ajax Amsterdam the football club). Ajax is a way to communicate from the front-end to the back-end and return the information back to the front-end. What we had to make was an user information app. We create a local database with names and made a search bar to search through this database and we needed to have the function to add names to the database. This assignment was quite complicated because we always get lectures about the basics (to get you started) and then the assignment is a lot more difficult then the lectures. Which forces you to figure out stuff by yourself and to me that is the quickest way of learning
